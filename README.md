# Design Patterns

A design pattern is just a guide to show how to solve a repeatable problem.

Depending on the design problem they address, design patterns can be classified in different categories, of which the main categories are:

* Creational Patterns
* Structural Patterns
* Behavioral Patterns

## Creational Patterns

These design patterns are all about class instantiation. This pattern can be further divided into class-creation patterns and object-creational patterns. While class-creation patterns use inheritance effectively in the instantiation process, object-creation patterns use delegation effectively to get the job done.

### Singleton

The singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.

Use a singleton if: "you need to have one and only one object of a type in system and you need to have global access to it."

### Builder

### Factory

### Abstract Factory

### Prototype

### Object Pool


## Structural Patterns

These design patterns are all about Class and Object composition. Structural class-creation patterns use inheritance to compose interfaces. Structural object-patterns define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionality.

### Adapter

### Bridge

### Composite

### Decorator

### Facade

### Flyweight

### Private Class Data

### Proxy



## Behaivioral Patterns

These design patterns are all about Class's objects communication. Behavioral patterns are those patterns that are most specifically concerned with communication between objects.

### Chain Of Responsibility

### Command

### Interpreter

### Iterator

### Mediator

### Memento

### Null Object

### Observer

### State

### Strategy

### Template Method

### Visitor

### Model-View-Controller (MVC)
